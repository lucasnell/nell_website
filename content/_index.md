I am a biologist that studies how interacting ecological and evolutionary 
dynamics can transform patterns of biodiversity, from genes to communities.
My approach combines data-intensive empirical methods (e.g., experiments, genomics)
with mathematical models based on specific biology, primarily in insect systems.
Because my empirical work often requires complex data analysis, 
I also <a href="resources">develop software</a> where the need arises.


I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the
<a href="https://ecologyandevolution.cornell.edu">Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology</a>
at Cornell University, where I work with
