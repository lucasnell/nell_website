I am a biologist that studies how interacting ecological and evolutionary
processes shape populations and species.
Processes I find especially interesting span
from species interactions and mechanisms of coexistence
to speciation and genome evolution.
Given the conceptual breadth of questions that intrigue me,
I use a range of approaches (e.g., theory, experiments, population genomics) and
systems (e.g., insect host--parasitoid, microbial competitors) to address them.


I currently work with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/">Tadashi Fukami</a>
as an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University.
