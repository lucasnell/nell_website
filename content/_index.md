I am a biologist that studies how populations and communities are shaped by
interacting ecological and evolutionary dynamics that play out across space.
Given the conceptual breadth of questions that intrigue me,
I use a range of approaches (e.g., theory, experiments, population genomics) and
systems (e.g., insect host--parasitoid, microbial competitors) to address them.


I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the
<a href="https://cihmid.cornell.edu">Cornell Institute of Host-Microbe
Interactions and Disease</a>
where I work with
