My interests lie in population genomics and evolutionary ecology, and I am particularly
fascinated by how ecological (e.g., population dynamics, species interactions) and genomic
processes interact. For my dissertation I am focusing on developing tools for simulating highthroughput
sequencing for populations with complex demographic histories and on the properties
underlying clonal evolution in experimental populations of pea aphids.

I am most fascinated by how complex networks of species interactions drive community
structure and evolutionary outcomes—and how they themselves are shaped by natural
selection. I seek to pursue these questions using a combination of computational,
experimental, and comparative field approaches.

I'm a PhD student in the lab of [Dr. Anthony Ives](http://ives.labs.wisc.edu)
in the [Department of Integrative Biology](http://ibio.wisc.edu/),
[University of Wisconsin–Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/).

My research focuses on the properties shaping species' evolution.
I am particularly interested in how evolution and ecology interact and
how genomic processes affect evolutionary dynamics.
