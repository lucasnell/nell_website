What happens when we take a well-understood ecological system, 
like a simple community of interacting species, and drop it into a more complex
landscape of interconnected communities?
What if we instead allow each species to evolve traits in response to one another?
These types of interactions across biological and spatial scales
can fundamentally alter ecological and evolutionary dynamics.
My research addresses such questions using a combination of data-intensive
empirical methods (e.g., experiments, genomics)
and mathematical models based on specific biology, primarily in insect systems.
