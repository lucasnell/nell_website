I'm a PhD student in the
<a href="http://ives.labs.wisc.edu">Ives lab</a>
at the 
<a href="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</a>.


My research focuses on how interacting ecological and evolutionary processes
shape populations and species.
Processes I find especially interesting span
from species interactions and mechanisms of coexistence,
to speciation and genome evolution.
I use a combination of experiments, theory, and population genomics
to address these questions at various scales.
