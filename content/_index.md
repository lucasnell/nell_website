I'm a PhD student in the lab of [Dr. Anthony Ives](http://ives.labs.wisc.edu)
in the [Department of Integrative Biology](http://ibio.wisc.edu/),
[University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/).

My research focuses on how populations are shaped
by interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes.
My interests span from species interactions and mechanisms of coexistence
to maintenance of genetic diversity and genome evolution.
I address these questions using a combination of experiments, modeling, 
theory, and population genomics.
