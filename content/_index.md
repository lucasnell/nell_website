I am a biologist that studies how interacting ecological and evolutionary
processes shape organisms at various biological scales.
Two major themes in my research are
(1) reciprocal effects between trait evolution and species interactions and
(2) molecular evolution and population ecology.
Given the conceptual breadth of questions that intrigue me,
I use a range of approaches (e.g., theory, experiments, population genomics) and
systems (e.g., insect host--parasitoid, microbial competitors) to address them.


I currently work with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fukamit/">Tadashi Fukami</a>
as an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University.
