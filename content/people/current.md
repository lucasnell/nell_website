My areas of research are community ecology, population biology, evolutionary ecology, and phylogenetics. Although I have research projects involving different questions and different experimental systems, almost all involve temporal dynamics, spatial dynamics, or spatio-temporal dynamics – how things vary through time and space. While some projects are purely mathematical, most combine theory and data.

I study the intersection of population dynamics, species interactions, and ecosystem processes in aquatic environments. My current research explores the causes and consequences of midge population fluctuations in Lake Mývatn, Iceland.

I am interested in the relationship between ecosystem level processes and ecological communities, as well as trophic interactions. As a graduate student, I am a member of the LTREB project studying Lake Mývatn. Part of my current research focuses on the linkages between the pelagic and benthic habitats of Lake Mývatn. This includes understanding the indirect interactions between benthic and pelagic primary producer communities and how nutrients move between these two habitats (and how the benthic invertebrate community influences this process).

My research involves investigating phenotypic plasticity and its population and community effects through multiple spatial and temporal scales.

I am interested in the evolution and ecology of species interactions. My PhD research explores how community interactions drive evolution in pea aphids, their symbionts, and natural enemies.

(with [Monica Turner](http://landscape.zoology.wisc.edu/People/Turner.html))

With a background in mathematics, I find most ecological and evolutionary patterns interesting. As such, my research questions range from physiology to biogeography. Still, I redouble my interest in questions that pertain to conservation especially in quantifying ecological thresholds and transient dynamics. I address these questions by developing mathematical and statistical models. In doing so, I strive to seek a balance between mathematical tractability and biological realism, and aim to foster feedback between theoreticians and empiricists.
