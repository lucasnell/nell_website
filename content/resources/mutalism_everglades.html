<h2>Facilitation between nesting wading birds and alligators</h2>
<p>Facilitation (a positive between-species exchange mediated through habitat improvement)
is widespread and being increasingly recognized for its importance in structuring
communities and shaping species’ distributions. For my thesis research, I assessed how a
keystone species is affected by associating with a group of organisms it often
consumes—yet also protects.</p>
<p>Wading birds (herons, egrets, storks, ibises, spoonbills) nest near alligators in the
Everglades, probably because alligator presence deters devastating nest predators such
as raccoons and opossums. My research at the University of Florida examined the other
side of this relationship and assessed what benefits, if any, alligators might derive
from associating with wading birds. The illustration below shows the four ways we
believe alligators might benefit (from left to right):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Juvenile birds foraging near colonies</li>
<li>Increased aquatic prey abundance (e.g., sirens, crayfish, fishes) driven by nutrients
from bird guano</li>
<li>Chicks and other material falling from nests directly to alligators</li>
<li>Nest predators drawn to colonies</li>
</ol>

<p>We first estimated the amount of food via pathway #3 by examining 14 years of wading bird
nest-success data and by catching fallen regurgitated fish. We found that regurgitant
appears to be of minor importance to alligators, but fallen
nestlings could be a significant source of food<sup>1</sup>. In prolific years, nestling
carcasses alone could sustain most of the breeding female alligators in our study
population for much of the dry season. Although we knew that alligators often can be
observed near and within colonies (see <a href="https://youtu.be/34cmq9la-Jw">this video</a> and
Fig S1 from <a href="https://goo.gl/Wb3vP7">here</a>), we hadn’t yet demonstrated how this
potentially substantive food source might affect alligators in the field.</p>

<p>So to the field we went. We captured alligators in similar habitat with and without
nesting colonies, and measured body condition via a morphometric index (i.e., a measure
of mass in relation to length). We found significantly higher condition in colony
alligators, even when controlling statistically for a range of environmental
factors<sup>2</sup>. Given the magnitude of the difference we detected, there are likely
population-level effects of wading bird nesting colonies on alligators. We also believe
that associations between nesting birds and crocodilians could be widespread and
ecologically important for many tropical and subtropical wetlands.</p>
