<p>The effects of species interactions on communities often change with conditions
in ways that remain unclear.
Common plant epiphytic bacteria in the genus <em>Pseudomonas</em> can kill and
repel pea aphids that transmit costly viruses among pea plants,
which could provide local benefits to peas.
However, repelling of aphids could lead to greater crowding and
disproportionately more production of winged aphids on low-<em>Pseudomonas</em> plants.
An increase in winged aphids should increase aphid-mediated virus
transmission, resulting in negative effects on pea plants at larger
spatial scales.
Further complicating these interactions, plant viruses can often attract
insect vectors, and by reducing aphid densities, aphid predators and
parasitoids may modify how this symbiosis affects pea plants by reducing
aphid crowding.
We used mathematical modeling to understand when the <em>Pseudomonas</em>â€“pea
symbiosis is a net benefit versus cost for pea plants.
Our results indicate that by killing aphids, <em>Pseudomonas</em> is usually beneficial
to pea plants.
However, when natural enemies (parasitoid wasps) suppress
aphid abundances, they can make the pseudo-crowding effect more pronounced
and cause <em>Pseudomonas</em> presence to have a net negative effect on pea plants.
Our results provide a rare case study of how spatial scale and
community interactions can together dictate the nature of multipartite
and multitrophic interactions.</p>
