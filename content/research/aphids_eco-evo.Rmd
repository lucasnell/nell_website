Feedbacks between evolutionary and ecological processes that occur because
they operate on similar timescales is called eco-evo dynamics.
For eco-evo dynamics to persist, the variation underlying both 
processes must be maintained, yet this fundamental component of eco-evo 
dynamics has received little attention.
Pea aphids can evolve resistance to parasitoid wasps rapidly enough to affect 
the host--parasitoid dynamics.
Through long-term lab experiments and simulations, we show that aphids 
dispersing among patches that vary in parasitoid abundance can produce both
the ecological stability and balancing selection necessary for ongoing
eco-evo dynamics.
