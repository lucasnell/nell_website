Evolutionarily related species are likely to share many of the same traits due to their phylogenetic descent from a common ancestor. With Ted Garland (UC-Riverside) as a frequent collaborator, I develop statistical methods to investigate phylogenetic correlations of traits among species. Because the occurrence and abundance of species in ecological communities depend on their traits, community composition is also likely to show phylogenetic patterns with, for example, phylogenetically related species more likely to occur in the same communities. Thus, I am extending methods derived for comparisons of traits among species to compare the compositions of different ecological communities.
