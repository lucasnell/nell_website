Theory has yielded many mechanisms that can affect coexistence of
competing species.
We're using a general model of coevolving competitors to gain broad insights
into how coevolution affects coexistence.
We find that the suite of possible communities is largely determined 
by tradeoffs and 
by how evolution by one species affects competition experienced by others.
These two factors combine with the evolutionary history of resident species
to determine how permissive communities are to the addition of 
new species.
