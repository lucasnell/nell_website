Long-duration bottlenecks are known to reduce genetic diversity, but what 
happens when populations experience frequent, short-duration bottlenecks?
How does this vary across the genome?
I'm exploring these questions with a population of midges in Lake M&yacute;vatn, 
Iceland, where they have irregular population fluctuations of about 5 orders 
of magnitude.
The Lake M&yacute;vatn long-term monitoring project
(led by Dr. &Aacute;rni Einarsson) has
gathered midge densities, environmental data, 
and abundances for many other species at M&yacute;vatn since 1977.
They have also collected and stored midge samples across this same period,
which we used to generate whole-genome sequencing that spans 24 years 
and 3 major population crashes.
I am leveraging this time series of whole-genome and ecological data
to assess how genomic structure is affected by extreme population dynamics,
and how these effects interact with biotic and abiotic factors.
