<p>Feedbacks between evolutionary and ecological processes that occur because
they operate on similar timescales is called eco-evo dynamics.
For eco-evo dynamics to persist, the variation underlying both
processes must be maintained, yet this fundamental component of eco-evo
dynamics has received little attention.
Pea aphids can evolve resistance to parasitoid wasps rapidly enough to affect
the hostâ€“parasitoid dynamics.
Through long-term lab experiments and simulations,
we showed that moderate aphid dispersal among fields combined with
non-random parasitoid dispersal
cause both species coexistence and balancing selection.
These two forms of dispersal together resulted in stable, persistent
eco-evo dynamics
