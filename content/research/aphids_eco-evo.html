<p>In the pea aphid, shifts in the frequencies of clonal lines with resistance
to parasitoid wasps can happen rapidly enough to affect their ecological
dynamics.
For these “eco-evo dynamics” to remain important, pea aphid populations must
somehow maintain variability in parasitoid resistance.
Through lab experiments and simulations, we are
trying to understand the ecological ramifications of eco-evo dynamics
in this host–parasitoid system.
We also aim to describe the ecological mechanisms that maintain variation in
parasitoid resistance among pea aphids.</p>
