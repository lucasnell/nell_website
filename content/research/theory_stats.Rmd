I am involved in several projects, most of them collaborative, investigating the complex dynamics that some species exhibit. For example, Ãƒrni Einarsson, Vincent Jansen, Arnthor Gardarsson and I demonstrated that the extremely large but irregular fluctuations in the abundance of midges in Lake Myvatn, Iceland, could be explained by a model showing alternative dynamical states. The observed dynamics appear to shift stochastically between the two states, a high stable point and a 5-orders-of-magnitude cycle, producing dramatic and unpredictable population patterns.
