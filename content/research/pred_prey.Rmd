Pea aphids in Wisconsin alfalfa fields rarely reach densities sufficient to cause crop damage due to high levels of predation and parasitism. How do predators and parasitoids act to suppress aphid populations in a persistent, stable fashion? And how does evolution counteract the effects of environmental fluctuations and predators on aphids? To address these problems, I employ experiments both in the lab and in the field, and integrate the results of the experiments using a variety of theoretical tools. As a method to explore aphid evolution, I am taking advantage of the numerous bacterial symbionts of aphids (part of the aphid extended genome) that confer heat tolerance and resistance to parasitoids and parasites. This is part of a project with Jason Harmon (NDS), Kerry Oliver (UG-Athens), and Volker Radeloff (UW-Madison).
