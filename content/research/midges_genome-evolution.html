<p>I am leveraging the extreme biology of chironomid midges
(family Chironomidae, order Diptera) to understand how population ecology
shapes genome evolution in natural populations.
Chironomids are the most widely distributed group of freshwater insects
and inhabit a vast range of habitats, many of which are inhospitable
(e.g., Antarctica, hot springs).
Yet we know little about the shared features underlying chironomids’
ability to tolerate extreme environments and
how they achieve this despite especially compact genomes.
In a recent paper, I described a number of candidate genes and gene families
that may relate to chironomid tolerance to stress and
show that their compact genomes are via reductions in repeat and
non-coding elements
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evae086">(Nell et al. 2024, <em>Genome Biology and Evolution</em>)</a>.
In a related project, I am using an example of extreme population dynamics
to understand what happens to genetic diversity when
populations experience frequent, short-duration bottlenecks.
The population of <em>Tanytarsus gracilentus</em> at Lake Mývatn, Iceland,
has irregular population fluctuations of about 5 orders of magnitude.
In collaboration with Árni Einarsson (Director, Mývatn Research
Station), I collected and sequenced <em>T. gracilentus</em> samples from Mývatn that
spanned 24 years and 3 population crashes, and from 15 other lakes across
northern Iceland.
Our results so far are consistent with theoretical predictions about the
effects of short-duration population crashes.
Further analyses will provide greater insights into how the complex
population dynamics present in many real populations shapes genome-wide
patterns of genetic diversity.</p>
