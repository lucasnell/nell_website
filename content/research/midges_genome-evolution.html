<p>How do complex population dynamics structure genomes in wild populations?
I’m exploring this question with a population of midges in Lake Mývatn,
Iceland, where they have irregular population fluctuations of about 5 orders
of magnitude.
As part of a long-term monitoring project at Mývatn,
Dr. Árni Einarsson has estimated midge densities, and
collected and stored midge samples since 1977.
I aim to leverage this time series of whole-genome and ecological data
to assess how genomic structure is affected by population dynamics.</p>
