<p>Long-duration bottlenecks are known to reduce genetic diversity, but what
happens when populations experience frequent, short-duration bottlenecks?
How does this vary across the genome?
I’m exploring these questions with a population of midges in Lake Mývatn,
Iceland, where they have irregular population fluctuations of about 5 orders
of magnitude.
The Lake Mývatn long-term monitoring project
(led by Dr. Árni Einarsson) has
gathered midge densities, environmental data,
and abundances for many other species at Mývatn since 1977.
They have also collected and stored midge samples across this same period,
which we used to generate whole-genome sequencing that spans 24 years
and 3 major population crashes.
I am leveraging this time series of whole-genome and ecological data
to assess how genomic structure is affected by extreme population dynamics,
and how these effects interact with biotic and abiotic factors.</p>
