<p>Species interactions can often allow for multiple different discrete states,
or alternative community states, into which a given community can assemble.
Which state is realized depends on initial conditions, and
this role of history makes predicting community outcomes notoriously difficult.
Feedbacks across spatial scales coupled with coevolution within communities
further complicates matters.
I will use the well-described study system of microbes in
<em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em> nectar to study how rapid evolution alters
alternative community states at both single-community and metacommunity scales.</p>
