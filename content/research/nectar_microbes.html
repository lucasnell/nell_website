<p>Non-random dispersal can promote regional coexistence
despite local priority effects and negligible immigration.
In the many cases of animal-mediated dispersal,
hitchhikers can coexist regionally when animal vectors
respond to environmental cues.
However, this possibility has been poorly understood,
particularly when local priority effects lead to
history-dependent exclusion.
We used a mathematical model of competitive communities of nectar
microbes in sticky monkeyflower (<em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em>)
to study how feedbacks between microbial communities and
pollinator-mediated dispersal affect coexistence.
Analysis of this model suggests that regional coexistence occurs only
when microbial communities influence pollinator visit frequency.
This microbe–pollinator feedback creates positive density-dependence at
the plant scale that results in spatial niche partitioning
across multiple plants.
This partitioning facilitates mutual invasibility and stable regional
coexistence of microbes.
Our results highlight the importance of interactions between dispersal and
community composition across scales in shaping patterns of species coexistence
